I love math, coding, and data. Since finishing my phd in algebraic topology (2013) I've been teaching high school math. I started to integrated more coding into my teaching 5 years ago and have not looked back! I've introduced entire grades of students to Jupyter notebooks, led a calculus class to implement gradient descent and solve regression problems, watched students implement k-means from scratch to compress images, and most recently led an independent study on image classification with deep learning.

Here are some of my own projects. Tools I use include Python, NumPy, pandas, scikit-learn, keras, tensorflow among others.
 
2. Billboard Top 100 with Spotify Audio Features (EDA + Classification)

  Continuing with the music trend, I analyzed Billboard's Top 100 charts from 1958 to 2018. There are 2 data sets that need to be cleaned and joined. One is the info on each weekly chart. What songs are on the chart with their current position and a variety of other details. The second data set is the extracted audio features for each song on those charts using Spotify's API.
  
   It was neat to see some of the trends, in particular song length. I built several models to classify the age of a song based on it's audio features. I used the following models: multiple linear regression, decision tree, random forest regressor, and sequential neural network.

Project 1: Rolling Stone's Top 500 

  This project is an exploration of Rolling Stones top 500 albums of all time. I looked at the breakdown by genre and over time. There's a    lot of Rock, and a lot of it comes from 1970-1980!
